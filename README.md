# BuildingEscape

This project is part of the Unreal Engine Game Development Course in C++ from Udemy. 

It is a basic project that introduced the Unreal Engine and how to put multiple components together to make a working escape the room task.

The game involves escaping a room by triggering an area of the room (hinted to by a light) and then running through the door. The door closes right before the player can get to it unless they find an object to place in the trigger area that will keep the door open.
